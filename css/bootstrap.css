/* Place your theme's base styles here! */
/* Remember, this theme uses media queries for responsive layouts! */
/* This means that you should only put styles here that are common to all screen sizes. */




/* If you are using the "Enable Ajax Loader" option from Zentropy, you can customize the loader using the below selector */
/* Zentropy ships with a sweet spinning Druplicon Ajax Loader but we understand it may be a bit too awesome for everyday use. */

/*.zentropy-loader .zentropy-loader-image {
  background-image: url('../images/your-awesome-loader.gif');
}*/



/* If you are using the CSS3Pie component, add the following style to the selectors you want to support: */
/* behavior: url('/sites/all/libraries/css3pie/PIE.htc'); */
/*  For example:

    .rounded-corners {
      -moz-border-radius: 6px;
      -webkit-border-radius: 6px;
      border-radius: 6px;
      behavior: url('/sites/all/libraries/css3pie/PIE.htc');
    }

    NOTE: If you are having trouble with certain elements, adding "position: relative;" can help fix things!
